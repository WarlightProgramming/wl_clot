	<h1>Welcome to ps's House of Warlight CLOTs!</h1>
	<p>We have 2 multiday ladders running for you this fine evening:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="random3vs3">3vs3 Random Teams (Rotating Template, Multiday)</a></li>
	<li><a href="europe3vs3">3vs3 Fixed Teams (Europe Warlords, Multiday)</a></li>
	</ul>
	<!--<p>So why don't you stay a while? Stay forever!</p>-->
	<p>These fine items are only fit for consumption by paid-account <a href="http://warlight.net">Warlight</a> members.</p>
	<p>If you are one of them and wish to join one of these ladders please post a request on the respective forum thread.</p>
	<!--<p>Hopefully the next warlight update will allow for a secure way to authenticate users through CLOT, which will allow you to add and remove yourself, provided i also finish the code to handle that.<br>Should be soon! (tm) (c)</p>-->
	<p>Please Flattr to support further development:<br>
